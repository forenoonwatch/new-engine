# New Engine

## Description

A 3D game engine written in OpenGL. Heavily influenced by [CGFX5](https://github.com/bennyqbd/CGFX5) before I began understanding more of the core concepts and broke out into my own layouts such as [nx-engine](https://github.com/forenoonwatch/nx-engine). Features some of my most primitive attempts at various engine systems and techniques.

See the following for (slightly) better examples of my work:

- [nx-engine](https://github.com/forenoonwatch/nx-engine)
- [block-systems](https://github.com/forenoonwatch/block-systems)
- [ocean-rendering](https://github.com/forenoonwatch/ocean-rendering)
